Java neural networks

I created this project to learn about neural networks and deep learning using Java. The initial commit is a standalone, fairly naive
implementation of a multilayer perceptron network using the well-known wine dataset as a training test case.

Further iterations will refine the design, add test and failure cases, and expand to other network types.
